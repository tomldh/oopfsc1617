Exercise 1 STL Container Types

1. Array/Vector, as the indices of the nodes are sequential and the total size of the grid does not change. There's also no removal of nodes involved.

2. Stack/deque for storing pivot elements, as the pivot elements need to be retrieved/removed from the container in certain order(FILO/FIFO). Also, the number of the elements in the container is dynamic. 
Vector/array for data elements, as the number of the data elements does not change and sorting only involves swapping data elements by direct indexing. Also, the data elements follows certain sequential order after sorting.

3. Deque, as it has FIFO mechanism.

4. Map, as the indices (can be stored as pair or tuple) can be used as the key to find the corresponding value.
