Exercise 1 STL Container Types

1. Array/Vector, as the indices of the nodes are sequential and the total size of the grid does not change. There's also no removal of nodes involved.

2. Stack/deque for storin pivot elements, as the size is dynamic and the pivots need to be retrieved/removed in the order by which they are inserted.
Array for data elements, as the number of the data elements does not change and the data follows certain sequential order.

3. Deque, as it has FIFO mechanism.

4. Map, as the indices (can be stored as pair or tuple) can be used as the key to find the corresponding value.
