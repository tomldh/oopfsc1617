Exercise 4:


int foo ( const int& );
int bar ( int& );

int main()
{
	int i = 0; //ok
	int& j = i; //ok
	static const int f = i; //ok
	int* const p = 0; //ok
	p = &i; //not allowed, because p is a constant pointer, the address held by p cannot be changed.
	*p = f; //allowed, but undefined result. Program might crash.
	const int& l = j; //ok
	const int& k = f; //ok
	foo ( j ); //ok
	bar ( l ); //not allowed, cannot bind a plain reference to l (reference to const)
	foo ( k ); //ok
}
